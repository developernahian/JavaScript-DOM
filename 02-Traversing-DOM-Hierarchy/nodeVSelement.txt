Node:  tag, comment, space, text all count hoy
----------------------------------------------
* A Node is a more generic interface from which many DOM objects inherit. 

* It can represent any type of object in the DOM tree: elements, text content, comments, etc.

* Types of nodes include:
        -Element (an HTML tag)
        -Text (actual text inside an element)
        -Comment (comments in HTML)
        -Document (the entire document)

* All objects that implement the Node interface can have properties like parentNode, childNodes, nodeType, and nodeValue.




Element/Collection: tag gulo count hoy
------------------------------------
* An Element is a specific type of Node that represents an HTML element (e.g., <div>, <span>, <p>).

* It inherits from the Node interface but has more specific properties and methods related to HTML
  elements,such as getAttribute, setAttribute, innerHTML, classList, etc.

* An Element can only represent an HTML or XML tag, not text or comment nodes.
