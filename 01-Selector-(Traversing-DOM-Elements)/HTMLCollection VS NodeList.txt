 * HTMLCollection VS NodeList *

//Short summery start
Here's a breakdown of the return types for each of the methods you listed:

getElementsByTagName():   returns an HTMLCollection
getElementById():         returns a single Element object (not a collection)
getElementsByClassName(): returns an HTMLCollection
querySelector():          returns a single Element object (not a collection)
querySelectorAll():       returns a NodeList

So, to summarize:


HTMLCollection  VS   NodeList
--------             --------  
Dynamic              Stastic 
for of               for of and for each


HTMLCollection:
---------------
getElementsByTagName()
getElementsByClassName()


NodeList:
---------
querySelectorAll()
Single Element object:
getElementById()
querySelector()


Note that HTMLCollection and NodeList are both array-like objects, but they have some differences in terms of their behavior and the types of nodes they can contain, as I mentioned earlier.

Both HTMLCollection and NodeList are collections of DOM elements, but they have some key differences in behavior and functionality. Letâ€™s explore them with definitions, examples, and explanations.


1. HTMLCollection:
------------------
An HTMLCollection is a collection of DOM elements, typically returned by methods like getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName, and children. It's a live collection, meaning it automatically updates if the document changes (e.g., when elements are added or removed).


2. NodeList:
------------
A NodeList is a collection of nodes (which can be elements, text nodes, comments, etc.) returned by methods like querySelectorAll, childNodes, and getElementsByName. A NodeList can be either live or static, but the most common NodeLists (like those returned by querySelectorAll) are static (they don't automatically update).



 
Feature	              HTMLCollection                                    	NodeList
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Returned by	     |   getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName  |     querySelectorAll, childNodes

Type of nodes	 |   Only element nodes                         |   	Can be any node (element, text, comment)

Live vs Static	 |   Live (updates automatically)               |     Usually Static (unless from childNodes)

Array methods    |   Cannot use array methods directly          |     Can use forEach in modern browsers, but not other array methods

Access elements	 |   Can access elements using index (boxes[0])	|      Can access elements using index (nodes[0])






In Summary:
------------
* HTMLCollection is a live collection of element nodes only,
  and it automatically updates when changes are made to the DOM.

* NodeList is usually static (though it can be live in some cases like childNodes)
  and can contain any type of node (not just elements).
